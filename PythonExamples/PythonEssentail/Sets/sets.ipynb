    "We've seen a number of data structures in the lecture so far, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* string: an ordered collection of characters (eg. `'hello'`), so there is a character at index 0 (`'h'`), a character at index 1 (`'e'`), and so on.\n",
    "* list: an ordered collection of anything (eg. `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 1]`), so there is a thing at index 0 (the number `1`), a thing at index 1 (the number `2`), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are collections as well, but unlike strings and lists, they are _unordered_.  You can think of them as a \"bag\" or mathematical set of objects, and so it doesn't make sense to talk about which item in the set is \"first\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to create a set out of our example list `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 1]`, then we would get `1`, `2`, `3`, and `'a'`, but when we came to the second `1` we already have a `1` in the set and so we can't add it again.  So an additional distinction between sets and ordered collections like strings and lists is that you can't have duplicates in a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one other critical distinction between sets and lists: things stored in sets must be immutable (or technically, hashable).  So you can put strings, numbers and tuples into sets, but not dictionaries or lists (since they are mutable).\n",
    "\n",
    "So a set is an _unordered_ collection of _unique_, _immutable_ objects.\n",
