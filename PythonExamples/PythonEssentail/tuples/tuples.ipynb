    "So tuples are simpler than lists, they don't have as many features, and as a result thay can be more efficient in some places and they offer you some protection against certain types of errors.  If you want to make sure that nothing else in your code can unexpectedly change the value in a sequence that you are working with, then use a tuple rather than a list.\n",
