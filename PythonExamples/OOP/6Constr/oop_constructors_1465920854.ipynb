    "\n",
    "Python uses special methods and attributes to provide a lot of functionality, and the real power of OOP in Python is unlocked once we start to make use of these special methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "These special methods are distinguished by having names which start and end with double underscore characters, such as `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__add__` (and many others).  You may hear people saying these as \"double-under init\" or \"double-under repr\" (or sometimes even \"dunder init\").\n",
    "\n",
    "There are special methods for object construction and initialization (as we'll see later in this exercise), for producing printed representations (which we will discuss in the next lecture), for making objects callable like functions or iterable like lists (these are discussed in the Advanced Python course), or even for making objects work with arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some specially named attributes which follow the same double underscore convention, such as `__class__` and `__name__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically you don't see these special methods when using auto-complete in IPython unless you actually start typing the underscores.\n"

    "So the problem we ran into at the end of the last lecture was \"how do we ensure that every instance of class has a consistent set of attributes?\" The solution to this problem, at least in part, is what is called the \"constructor\" special method `__init__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python calls the `__init__` method whenever it creates a new instance of the class, so this gives you an opportunity to ensure that your objects start in a consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's take the `Leaf` example from the previous lecture and we want to ensure that every leaf has a color.  We can do that with an `__init__` method like this."
