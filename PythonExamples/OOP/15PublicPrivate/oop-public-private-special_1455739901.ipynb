    "The terms \"public\", \"private\", and \"special\" have special meaning in python that don't necessarily line up with their meanings in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen examples of special methods, those that start and end with `__` (double underscore).  There is also something often called a \"private\" method.  When we write a method that we don't intend for public use, by convention we name it with a leading underscore.  This doesn't keep anyone from calling the method, but IPython and many auto-completion-enabled editors will ignore those as being 'private'.  Just remember that Python doesn't really have a strong notion of private methods like other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "So \"private\" doesn't really mean \"private\" as used in other languages.  It is generally used for a method that is only intended for private use, even though it is actually possible to use it."
