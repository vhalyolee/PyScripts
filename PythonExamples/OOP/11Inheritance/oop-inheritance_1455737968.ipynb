    "So I just had a conversation with my co-worker who pointed out to me that my model for forest fires is not realistic because it assumes that the forest fires grow on the same time scale that the fires spread.\n",

    "He's right, in fact, and I should update my model, but I'd like to keep the slow-burn implementation, because it might be interesting for other slow-spreading-death simulations.\n",

    "So how can I make two different kinds of forest that share some of their behaviors but are distinct in other ways?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is to make use of *inheritance*.  We're going to define a *parent class* that has the features that are common to the children.  In our case, we want a Forest parent class that has arrays of trees and has a growth model.  In addition, the parent should be able to `advance_one_step`.  We'll hold off adding fires for now, because we may want to add other things later, like bark-beetles or fungal infections, that have spreading behavior.\n",
